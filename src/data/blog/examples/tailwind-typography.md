By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more.

## Table of contents

## What to expect from here on out

What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense to dogfood the plugin itself.

## Code should look okay by default.

Here is what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like:

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
};
```
